    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
    
    <p>
        Our passion for magic led to the decision to take the magic api and the ebay api and combine them. We wanted to create a place where
        people could search for the cards they want, or even list all of the cards to look through, and be given a place that they could buy it from.
        We thought that a very simple and clean design would be to have a filter block above the search bar.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Technical Decisions</h2>
    <p>
        I wanted to be able to strictly filter using the colors of the cards rather than just returning either one color or the other,
    but it turned out to be more complicated than I thought and I also did not have enough time to experiment with it. I really wanted to add multiple pages so 
    I added a button if there are 100 results, because only 100 can be returned, and if someone clicks on it the site will display the next page of results.
    </P>
    
    <h2>Extras<h2>
    <p>
        The extras are the filtered search system and the page system.
    </P>
	
	<h2>Credit</h2>
	
	<p>The APIs are used from the links above and are not ours. We are merely combining them.</p>
